dry indoor air may encourage Coronavirus spread,2
COVID-19 is shedding new light on how viruses can kick some patient's immune system into overdrive to deadly effect in what is known as a cytokine storm syndrome.,3
The antiviral drug remdesivir has been one of the few treatments that's seemed to help curb death rates in COVID-19 patients so ill that they need a ventilator.,30
Exposure to the sun or to temperatures higher than 77 F (25 C) doesn't prevent the COVID-19 virus or cure COVID-19.,42

heart attacks and strokes caused by blood clots appears to be the cause of death in some younger patients under the age of 50.,4
"Understanding these immune changes may help in finding treatments that work for older COVID-19 patients, but, it may also help younger people who may have some of the same problems without knowing it.",3
There is no evidence taking vitamin D supplements will protect people from Covid-19.,42
"chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which have been extensively used for the treatment of malaria with known safety and efficacy, also limit acidification of endosomes, Golgi vesicles, and lysosomes. These molecules significantly reduce SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.",5
ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) is a Common Cause of Death in Critically Ill Coronavirus Patients,4

"Cell that Ab8 is highly effective in preventing and treating SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice and hamsters. Its tiny size not only increases its potential for diffusion in tissues to better neutralize the virus, but also makes it possible to administer the drug by alternative routes, including inhalation. Importantly, it does not bind to human cells -- a good sign that it won't have negative side-effects in people.",5
"In some covid-19 patients, this decision might be influenced by known individual preferences.",4

Researchers have found that remdesivir is highly effective at fighting the novel coronavirus in isolated cells,30
Masks prevent the spread of COVID-19,44
"Several already approved drugs, including lopinavir (LPV), ritonavir, chloroquine, favipiravir, and remdesivir, an antiviral awaiting approval have been repurposed and their efficacy in fighting COVID-19 is being evaluated",5

wearing a face mask do not stopped person-to-person spread of the virus.,44
"Namely, winter is coming. On the minds of many restaurant owners is the fact that this month's mild weather is just weeks away from becoming a cold, windy, rainy mess, perhaps heavily impacting outdoor dining - one of the few ways restaurants have been able to (barely) scrape by.",2
"a person can also get the coronavirus if they touch a surface or object that has viral particles on it and then touch their mouth, nose, or eyes.",16
"Many experts believe that the rapid decline in certain COVID-19 patients, including those who need support from a ventilator, comes down to an individual's immune system",3
